            <h1>50 First Dates</h1>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #1</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    Hinata wanted his first date with Nishinoya to be perfect. It was his goal ever since he got a crush on the libero. He even declared it when Nishinoya agreed to go out with him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Yuu," he stated. "I'm gonna make this the best date of your life!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Hinata was forced to eat his words.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His first attempt at a date with Nishinoya went south quickly. Hinata spent too long getting ready &mdash; picking out the perfect outfit &mdash; that by the time he picked Nishinoya up, the movie they were planning on going to already started. Nishinoya had to sit by him and console him for about an hour before Hinata stopped crying about ruining their first date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I wanted it to be perfect," he said in-between tears.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya smiled softly as he wiped Hinata's tears away. "Shouyou, we didn't even go see the movie. So it doesn't count as a date, right? We can try again next week! I know you'll make it perfect," he assured and kissed Hinata's cheek, causing the tears to quickly stop.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #2</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    His second attempt went better, at least in the beginning. Hinata decided to take Nishinoya to an amusement park. They did have fun for the most part. That was until they got onto the rollercoasters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya was having the time of his life and Hinata wanted to do his best to have fun with him. Unfortunately, rollercoasters were the bane of Hinata's existence; he didn't just get scared, he got <em>sick</em> fast.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Long story short, Hinata puked on Nishinoya's lap halfway through their first ride.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time, it took even longer to console Hinata after they got home and Nishinoya changed his pants. It took two hours of holding hands and forehead kisses before Hinata was responsive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hey," Nishinoya smiled. "We didn't get to finish the ride, so it doesn't count as a date either. You get another shot, alright? It's gonna be okay, Shouyou."
                </p>

                <p>
                    He reached out to wipe Hinata's tears, hands cupping his cheek. Hinata wrapped his arms around Nishinoya and promised once again that next time would be perfect.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #3</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    And once again, Hinata ate his words.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time, they went out to eat at a Thai place which was Nishinoya's favorite. They decided to order for each other, whispering their orders to the waiter as a surprise. They laughed and talked while they waited.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When their food arrived, Nishinoya grinned. "It looks great!" He took a bite and immediately spat it out with widened eyes. "Shouyou, does this have peanuts in it?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata nodded slowly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'm allergic to peanuts!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Luckily, Nishinoya had an epipen so Hinata didn't have time to cry in-between all the fussing over him, making sure he was okay. Hinata's hands were on Nishinoya's cheeks, hovering over him as they stood in the parking lot outside of the restaurant in order to give Nishinoya some air. Hinata repeatedly asked if he was okay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya laughed, lightly knocking the hands away. "I told you, I'm fine!" He then wrapped his arms around Hinata. "Let me guess &mdash; you wanna try again for a perfect first date?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata nodded seriously, causing Nishinoya to chuckle and lean up to kiss his forehead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You're so cute," Nishinoya shook his head. "Alright, you get one more shot, okay? And then it's my turn."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata's eyes widened before he gave a determined look. "This time," he declared. "This time, I'm going to get it right! It's going to go perfectly."
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #4</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    Things went as followed:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata planned a picnic date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It rained.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya assured him that they could move the date inside but Hinata wouldn't hear it. He simply sat on Nishinoya's front porch, watching the rain with a devastated expression while the picnic basket was discarded on the side.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya sat down beside him and gently tilted Hinata's chin up. "Shouyou," he frowned. "I hate seeing you like this, especially when you work yourself up over nothing. It's not a big deal, you know? So our first didn't go well. So what?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "But-" Hinata had tears welling in his eyes. "I really wanted it to be special. I wanted you to remember it forever."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya softly smiled and kissed Hinata's forehead. "As if I could ever forget it, if it's with you," he grinned. "Now, you promised me it would be my turn next time. So here you go, Shouyou! I'll take you on a first date you'll never forget."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata swallowed, his tears fading a Nishinoya drew him in a hug.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #5</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    It didn't rain this time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya waited until nighttime to take Hinata out. They drove until they were out of town. Nishinoya led Hinata by his hand off the road and into the woods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "It's a bit of a hike," he warned as they walked through the weeds and up the hill.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata was a little exhausted by the time they reached the top but it was the view that really took his breath away.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They were far enough from town that the stars were visible, all of them shining in all their glory over the cityscape that stretched below them. Nishinoya sat down in the grass and Hinata followed, looking over the hillside up at the sky. The night was cloudless and the moon was nearly full; it was a gorgeous sight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata looked over at Nishinoya lying back on the grass. His cedar eyes shone with starlight, his smile almost glowing, and his hair windswept from the hike &mdash; he looked beautiful. Nishinoya caught his gaze and grinned, slightly laughing. Hinata thought it was his favorite sound in the world; that laugh.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "So?" Nishinoya asked, "Did I do a good job?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata nodded, smiling. "You did perfect," he leaned down to kiss Nishinoya, lips soft and sweet as they met.
                </p>

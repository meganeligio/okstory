            <h1>50 First Dates</h1>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #1</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    Hinata wanted his first date with Nishinoya to be perfect. It was his goal ever since he got a crush on the libero; He even declared it when Noya agreed to go out with him. “Yuu,” he said, “I'm gonna make this the best first date of your life!”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Hinata was being forced to eat his words.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His first attempt at a date with Noya went south quickly. Hinata spent so long getting ready, picking out the perfect outfit, that by the time he picked Noya up, the movie they were planning on going to had already started. Nishinoya had to sit by him and console him for about an hour before Hinata stopped crying about ruining their first date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I wanted it to be perfect,” Hinata said between tears, and Noya smiled softly as he wiped them away.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Shouyou,” he said, “we didn't even go see the movie. So it doesn't count as a date, right? We can try again next week. I know you'll make it perfect.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    He kissed Hinata on the cheek, then, and his tears quickly stopped.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #2</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    Attempt number two went better, at least in the beginning. Hinata decided to take Nishinoya to an amusement park. And they did have fun, for the most part. That is, until they got onto the roller coasters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Noya was having the time of his life, and Hinata wanted to do his best to have fun with him. Unfortunately, roller coasters were the bane of Hinata's existence. He didn't just get scared; He got sick, and he got sick fast.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Long story short, Hinata puked on Nishinoya's lap halfway through their first ride.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time it took even longer to console Hinata, after they got home and Nishinoya changed his pants. It took two hours of handholding and forehead kisses before he was responsive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Hey,” Noya said, “we didn't get to finish the ride, so it doesn't count as a date either. You get another shot, alright? It's gonna be okay, Shouyou.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya reached out to wipe at Hinata's tears, his hands cupping his cheeks. Hinata wrapped his arms around him and promised, once again, that next time would be perfect.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #3</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    And, once again, Hinata ate his words.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time they went out to eat; a Thai place, Noya's favorite. Hinata and Noya decided to
                    order for each other, whispering their orders to the waiter so that the other would be
                    surprised. They laughed and talked while they waited, and when the food arrived, Noya
                    smiled and said it looked great.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And then he took a bite, and immediately spit it out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Shouyou&ndash;Does this have peanuts in it?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata nodded slowly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I'm allergic to peanuts.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Luckily, Noya had an epipen. And Hinata didn't have time to cry between all his fussing over him, making sure he was okay. Hinata's hands were on Noya's cheeks, hovering over him as they stood in the parking lot of the restaurant for Noya to get some air, asking him over and over how he was doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Noya laughed, lightly knocking Hinata's hands away. “I told you, I'm fine,” he said, as he pulled his own arms around Hinata. “Let me guess&ndash;you want to try again for a perfect first date?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata nodded seriously, and Noya laughed again, leaning up to kiss him on the forehead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “You're cute,” he said, shaking his head. “Alright, you get one more shot, okay? And then it's my turn.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata's eyes widened before he looked at Noya seriously. “This time,” he declared, “this time I'm going to get it right. It's going to go perfectly.”
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #4</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    Things went as follows:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata planned a picnic date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It rained.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya assured him that they could move the date inside, but Hinata wouldn't hear it. He simply sat on Noya's front porch, watching the rain with a devastated expression, his picnic basket discarded beside him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Noya sat down beside him and gently tilted Hinata's head toward him by the chin. “Shouyou,” he said, “I hate seeing you like this. Especially when you work yourself up over nothing. It's not a big deal, you know? So our first date didn't go well. So what?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    “But&ndash;but&ndash;” Hinata looked over at him, tears welling in his eyes. “But I wanted it to be special. Wanted you to remember it forever.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Noya smiled softly, leaning up to kiss him on the forehead. “As if I could ever forget it, if it's with you.” He leaned back to grin at him. “Now, you promised me it would be my turn next time. So here you go, Shouyou: I'll take you on a first date that you'll never forget.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata swallowed, his tears fading as Noya drew him into a hug.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p><strong><em>Attempt #5</em></strong></p>

                <p>
                    It didn't rain, this time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nishinoya waited until night to take Hinata out. They drove until they were out of town, and Noya led Hinata by his hand off the road and into the woods. “It's a bit of a hike,” he warned, as they walked hand and hand through the weeds and up the hills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata was a little exhausted by the time they got to the top, but it was the view that really took his breath away.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They were far enough from town that the stars were visible, all of them in all their glory, shining over the cityscape that stretched out below them. Nishinoya sat down in the grass, and Hinata sat beside him and looked over the hillside, up at the sky. The night was cloudless, the moon nearly full, all of it gorgeous.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then Hinata looked to the side at Nishinoya, who was laying back in the grass. His eyes shone with starlight, his smile almost glowing, his hair windswept from the hike and still beautiful. He looked over at Hinata and grinned, laughing slightly; Hinata thought it was his favorite sound in the world, that laugh.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “So?” Noya asked. “Did I do a good job?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hinata nodded. “You did perfect,” he said, and he leaned down to kiss Noya, lips soft and sweet as they met.
                </p>

            <h1>A Case of Classic Jealousy</h1>

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p>
                    Sonic believed he is someone that's nice, positive, considerate and especially caring to his friends. He's happy whenever his friends become better versions of themselves or something nice happens to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But why does seeing Shadow getting along with Classic Sonic feel. . . wrong? Is 'wrong' the right word for these odd feelings?
                </p>

                <p>
                    It took weeks? Months maybe? For Sonic to get along with Shadow, and getting along only meant Shadow didn't frown at him every time they met.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet Classic Sonic was able to melt Shadow's cold icy heart in mere minutes the moment they
                    met.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A stiff smile was on Sonic's face as he watched Classic Sonic nuzzling against Shadow's
                    chest fur as Shadow held the small hedgehog carefully like a fragile porcelain doll.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'm surprised that Shadow can be this gentle," Tails said.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You and me both, little buddy. . ." Sonic said between grit teeth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone thought Shadow would scowl or push Classic Sonic away when they met but instead it was the opposite. The two met and Classic Sonic was nervous at first, only offering a shy wave and grin then after Shadow introduced himself with a small smile, Classic Sonic was all jumpy with his arms open wide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nobody expected Shadow to pick up the small blue hedgehog or even let Classic Sonic hug him and touch his chest fur. Nobody especially expected to see a small fond smile on Shadow's face when Classic nuzzled his cheek.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'm surprised but it's so cute that they're getting along," Amy said with a big smile. It's obvious she's happy to see Shadow relax.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But Sonic knows they're not just getting along. Sonic knows. Because after all Classic Sonic is still him. From the way Classic smiled and blushed at Shadow. Sonic knew.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic had a crush on Shadow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Yea. . . <em>Cute</em>," Sonic said, arms crossed with clenched fists. He doesn't know why he's feeling agitated seeing how close Classic and Shadow are being.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then the moment Classic made eye contact with Sonic, the little hedgehog offered a cheeky smile and nuzzled further against Shadow's cheeks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You. . . sure are an affectionate hedgehog," Shadow said and then he did something that shocked Sonic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow reciprocated Classic's affection. He nuzzled back. Classic was startled at first but then clung even tighter to Shadow with a large grin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic didn't know he'd been glaring until he felt a pat on the shoulder.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Glare any longer, I might start to think you're jealous of little Blue."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic turned to see Rouge snickering, he felt his cheeks heat up. "Wha&ndash;? No&ndash;! I'm not&ndash;! It's not like that, Rouge! I have no idea what you're talking about."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic turned away, trying to act like it was nothing while Rouge giggled and rolled her eyes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Whatever you say, Big Blue."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yea, Sonic is not jealous, he's not.
                </p>

            </div>

            <p class="line-break">· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·</p class="line-break">

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p>
                    The first time Sonic felt these odd mad feelings again was when he passed by the Chao Garden. Shadow was there relaxing with a book under a tree while Chaos floated around him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before Sonic could greet the ebony hedgehog, he saw Classic Sonic come running down the garden and stop right in front of Shadow with a daisy at hand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With rosy cheeks and nervous giddy smile, Classic poked Shadow's arm getting his attention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Oh Classic. . . what's this?" Shadow asked, setting down his book to look at the flower Classic held out. "Is this for me?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic nodded shyly and his smile brightened when Shadow took the flower.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Thank you. . . that's very kind of you Classic."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic soon gesture for Shadow to lean in who did so despite the confused look. The little blue hedgehog took the flower back then put the flower in between Shadow's quill and ear.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Oh. . . ah Classic, that's nice and all but I don't. . . you know. . . suit this&ndash;" Shadow got a bit flustered and tried to take the flower off but Classic grabbed Shadow's hand and shook his head then tugged him to the pond.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What are you doing. . .?" Shadow questioned, brows furrowed as he let himself get dragged over after making sure his book is bookmarked and safe on the ground.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic pointed to the pond and gestured for Shadow to look at his reflection, wanting Shadow to see how he looked with the flower in his quills. He waved his hand around trying to get his compliments across and from the way Shadow looked flustered, Sonic thinks Shadow did understand what Classic was trying to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From the way blush tinted Shadow's cheeks as a small serene smile appeared, he reached out and patted Classic's head thanking the little one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic felt he shouldn't intrude any longer and finally pulled his eyes away from two frantically leaving the scene.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic was confused on why he wanted to be the one that Shadow was smiling at.
                </p>

            </div>

            <p class="line-break">· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·</p class="line-break">

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p>
                    The second time Sonic felt those heavy feelings was when they were having lunch together with everyone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic sat just across the table from Shadow and of course Classic Sonic decided to sit beside Shadow where Rouge usually sat but Rouge didn't mind since it was an excuse to sit with Knuckles. Classic had been trailing behind Shadow like an imprinted duckling for days now, it wasn't a surprise for him to sit there. Sonic once again watched Classic, getting all of Shadow's attention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hm? You want a bite?" Shadow asked, pausing, eating his dessert. He pushed his plate to Classic once he received a nod. "Alright. . ."
                </p>

                <p>
                    But Classic didn't touch it, he simply opened his mouth and pointed to it, gesturing for Shadow to feed him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Eh? You want me to feed you? Can't you eat on your own?" Shadow replied.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic pouted and then gestured again with mouth wide open. Shadow can only sigh and feed him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Alright then, here."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic watched how the end of Shadow's lips quirked upward as Classic enjoyed the dessert Shadow hand fed him. The way the two smiled and the way Shadow was so gentle when cleaning away the mess left on Classic's mouth left a bad taste in Sonic's mouth. He didn't notice he was glaring and clenching his hands until Shadow called him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Oi, what are you staring at Hedgehog?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic blinked, snapping out of his stare and noticed how Shadow was scowling at him while Classic stared with curiosity as he chewed his food.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "N&ndash;nothing," Sonic stammer before placing his attention on his own food. "Why are you feeding him anyway? Can't the little guy eat on his own?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "He insisted," Shadow answered while patting Classic's head then looked at Sonic with a small teasing smirk. "Why ask? Want someone to feed you as well?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "NO!" Sonic frowned, almost slamming down his spoon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic only giggles but immediately stopped and looked away when Sonic glared at him. Shadow rolled his eyes and shook his head then turned his attention back to Classic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You both are a handful."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Am not. . ." Sonic muttered with a pout. He felt his cheeks heat up when Shadow looked at him with a raised brow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Are you sure?" Shadow chuckled then surprised Sonic by reaching out towards him. He felt Shadow run his thumb down the corner of his lips wiping away the remnants of his lunch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You eat messily, like an infant," Shadow's lips curled into a teasing grin. Nothing like his signature smirk or business polite smile. It's something genuine and rare and almost looked fond of Sonic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Seeing that, Sonic couldn't take it anymore. He covered his flustered stammer with a huff while picking up his dishes and left the dining room abruptly earning a few confused and a few knowing stares as the door slammed close behind the blue blur.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What is his problem?" Shadow muttered very confused by Sonic's sudden action earning a few snickers from their nearby companion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Probably because he got green eyed," Tails said with a giggle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "But he does have green eyes. . ." Shadow replied looking even more confused, making the others giggle even more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'm afraid it's not that kind of green eyes, Sunshine," Rouge said with an amused hum.
                </p>

            </div>

            <p class="line-break">· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·</p class="line-break">

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p>
                    Another time, Sonic gets this jealous feeling&mdash;yes, Sonic finally acknowledge this feeling called jealousy and yes, it took him a while to admit it&mdash;it is when he wanted to invite Shadow for a race.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He ran around headquarters to find Shadow and finally found him just near the exit. The black hedgehog was leaning by the wall with his backpack, arms crossed as if he were waiting for someone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Shadow! Buddy! There you are!" Sonic stopped in front of Shadow with a big grin while the other hedgehog looked confused but offered a nod of acknowledgement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What do you want?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Just wanted to know if you're up for a race! It's been a while hasn't it?" Sonic talked animatedly. "I say we have a race around the island, first one to get back here&ndash;"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'll have to decline your offer unfortunately."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Huh? What?" Sonic froze and felt like someone had punched him in the gut when Shadow rejected his offer to race. He wasn't expecting that Shadow would say no.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Why?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I had already made plans with Classic," Shadow said, pushing himself off the wall.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Classic. . . of course you did," Sonic murmured. It suddenly felt hard to keep this conversation going now. Jealousy started bubbling inside of him and the irrational part of him wanted to drag Shadow to race with him instead of spending time with Classic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fortunately for him, Shadow spoke first before he said anything foolish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ". . . Maybe later tonight? I am available after dinner."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic's ear perked up, a grin slowly stretched across his face as Shadow talked with their face turned to the side. "I. . . do want to stretch my legs, it has been a while. . ."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Sure! You're on! Better get ready to get your ass kicked!" Sonic exclaimed while bouncing on his feet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hmph, don't get ahead of yourself Hedgehog,” Shadow scoffed and smirked. “. . . we will see who's the real 'Fastest Thing Alive' here."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Well it's obviously me!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Big talk for someone who's about to lose."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "We'll see who's the&ndash;"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before Sonic finished his sentence, he was interrupted, once again by the little blue hedgehog that had been getting in his way for the past few days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He watched Classic bump and hug Shadow's leg, getting all of the dark hedgehog's attention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Classic, you're here, good to see you too, shall we get going then?" Shadow patted Classic on the head who happily accepted it. Shadow looked back up at Sonic and offered a farewell nod before turning away with Classic. "Alright, I'll see you later, Hedgehog."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Yea. . . sure, bye."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic gave a reluctant wave and watched the two walk to the exit together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You want a race? Well alright, don't think I'll go easy on you just cause you're younger, Classic."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic watched how Shadow flashed that challenging smirk at Classic and bit back a growl. Racing each other it's his and Shadow's thing! He's the one that should have that smirk not Classic!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic huffed and stormed off to his room while trying to calm himself by thinking about the promised race later in the evening.

                    The fourth time Sonic got jealous was during a mission. They were wiping out and cleaning up the remaining Badniks. It was supposedly just Sonic, Tails and Knuckles but they were joined by Team Dark which Sonic had no complaints about at all. He loved teaming up with Shadow since teasing him was extremely fun and had been hard to do lately with that little blue nuisance hanging around Shadow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And of course he would be here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Careful, don't let the claw from that robot get you, the claws are sharp, you'll get seriously injured," Shadow said.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Shadow, this isn't my first rodeo with Egghead's robots," Sonic replied with a light confident huff.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'm talking to Classic," Shadow said with a raised brow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of fuc&ndash;fricking course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic let out a soundless sigh and rolled his eyes. "Classic knows too, we have been fighting Eggman all our life after all."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Yes, but I would still be worried, he's small and is currently younger than Cream," Shadow offered a nod to Classic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of Sonic's eyes twitched as he strained his smile at how Classic's eyes just beam with happiness from Shadow showing his care for him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Stay close to me," Shadow said to Classic before zipping off with Classic quickly catching up to him and willingly sticking to his side.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic is frustrated and it's a good thing he was in battle right now since he could take his pent up anger out on the robots hoping no one would sense any difference but of course it didn't go unnoticed by his close friends.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Sonic, are you ok?" Tails asked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Me? Ok? Of course! Pfft&ndash;how can I not be ok? I'm Sonic The Hedgehog, of course I'm ok."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Are you sure? You're a little more aggressive than usual and even more distracted," Knuckles said with a frown. "I'm probably not in the place to say this but you really got to keep your jealousy in control."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic's eyes widened and his jaw dropped as he let out an offended gasp.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Knuckles, the easily jealous guy telling Sonic, the extremely laid back chill guy to keep his jealousy in control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I&ndash;I'm not. . . pfft. . . what? Me? Jealous? What? I'm not jealous, totally not jealous, nuh uh, there's no way Sonic The Hedgehog is jealous, what is there to be jealous of anyway? I'm chill, totally chill, the most chill guy in the whole world, I'm completely and utterly not jealous at all cause there's nothing to be jealous of!" Sonic spoke a little too quickly and his hands flailed about with a strained smile to prove his point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tails and Knuckles were not convinced. Tails offered a nervous smile with drooped ears while Knuckles had his arm crossed with a disapproving look as if telling him to just accept the fact that he's jealous and do something about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic may have acknowledged being jealous but there is no way he would admit it out loud.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Whatever you say, Sonic The Jealoushog," Knuckles teased.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic huffed and was ready to launch at Knuckles but stopped when someone's voice caught his attention. His ears pointed up at Shadow's voice and he looked to the side to see Shadow set Classic down on a big rock before bending down and taking out the little first aid kit he always carried around.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "This is why I told you to be careful, now look at you. . ." Shadow said and cleaned Classic's scraped knee softly. "I know it'll sting but bear with it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic nodded and watched Shadow do his thing with light blush, a little embarrassed as he wanted to show Shadow that he was strong and capable but having Shadow taking care of him is nice too. Seeing Shadow patching him up so gently made his heart do a few flips.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You should kiss it better for him, Sunshine," Rouge teased, her teal eyes glinting mischievously.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Kiss it better!?</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic frowned at the thought and crossed his arms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>There's no way Shadow would do that right?</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Huh? Why would I do that?" Shadow asked as he stuck on a bandaid.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "They said it'll take the pain away, you remember how Vanilla would kiss the pain away for Cream," Rouge said, the grin never left her face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow seemed to be taking this seriously as he pondered before looking up at Classic and asked. "Would you like me to kiss it better?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hearing that, Sonic's heart dropped and he gripped his arms tighter, fingers digging deeper into his skin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>No fair, no fair, no fair, this is not fair.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    He was practically glaring daggers at the little blushing blue hedgehog who was too deep in bliss to realise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic only snapped out of it when he felt someone tap on his shoulder and drag him forward. Sonic blinked a few times and just let Tails drag him to where Shadow is. He was confused but he didn't mind once Shadow pulled his attention away from Classic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Shadow! Hey! Do you mind also helping to patch up Sonic?" Tails asked, pointing to Sonic's hand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Huh. . . he didn't notice that his knuckle was slightly bleeding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I would do it personally myself but I lost my first aid kit mid battle," Tails said as he lightly nudged Sonic to Shadow. "I really appreciate it if you help!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic blinked once and realised what Tails was doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bless his soul, Sonic is going to buy a dozen cans of mint candy for Tails.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Alright. . . get over here you clumsy hedgehog."
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Sonic wasn't in control himself, his tail would be wagging so much right now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Instead of getting a kiss on his injuries for it to get better, he got a smack in the head for teasing <span class="strike">asking</span> Shadow for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time Sonic's jealousy got even more obvious. (Sonic insisted it's not obvious but everyone already knows he's jealous).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was during an afternoon on a good day. He was on his way to a meeting when he noticed a small crowd standing by the door to the nap room.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "They're so cute. . .!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Amy, shhh, not so loud."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What's going on?" Sonic asked from behind only to get shush.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You'll wake them up if you're too loud. . .” Rouge said and pointed inside.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic was confused as he looked inside only to see Shadow and Classic resting with each other. Shadow was laying on the couch with Classic laying on top of him as Shadow patted his back rhythmically. Classic looked completely content and relaxed, head buried in Shadow's soft chest fur.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Unfair, unfair, so unfair.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic pouted and crossed his arm. "They're just napping. . . besides, shouldn't we get on with our meeting?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Since when does Sonic The hedgehog attend the meeting on time?" Knuckles teased.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Let them rest a bit more Big Blue, they've been working really hard together," Rouge added on with a little snickers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic frowned. "I attend meetings on time, just, I only appear when you guys talk about the important stuff." <em>And I work hard too! I deserve a nap and a pass for only listening to the important points of the meeting.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic glances back at the two sleeping figures. He watched Classic stirred a little in his sleep and Shadow immediately rubbed his back with a soft shush and cooed Classic back to sleep which worked like a charm. He can't help but to imagine him being the one laying on top of Shadow and napping with Shadow. He wanted to be the receiving end of Shadow's affection and comfort. It's unfair that Classic gets all of Shadow's attention just because he's young.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not wanting to end up doing something stupid because of his feelings, Sonic decided to leave but on the way, he ended up bumping into Knuckles causing Knuckles to bump into the doorframe making a loud bang.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Both Shadow and Classic startled awake. Classic got up quickly and was ready to attack whatever woke him up as Shadow quickly tried to calm him down, reassuring him that he was safe. Shadow glared at the crowd while patting Classic's back, a low growl left his mouth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Do you mind?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The others could only chuckle nervously under Shadow's heavy glare. Most of them had quickly run off to the meeting to avoid Shadow's rage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Sorry that Knuckles woke you up from your nap time with little Blue, Sunshine,” Rouge said with a light giggles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “What?!” Knuckles gasped aloud and immediately pointed his finger at Sonic. “It's not my fault! Sonic bumped into me!”
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I swear it was an accident!” Sonic quickly put up both his hands in surrender, trying hard to show his innocence. He really didn't mean to wake them up!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow scoffed and sat up with Classic still resting on his laps. “No matter, it's already meeting time right? I'll join you guys in a moment.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Take your time Shadow, we'll see you there,” Rouge waved and walked off with Knuckles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic gazed ahead then looked back into the room watching Shadow waking Classic up gently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “How are you feeling? That didn't scare you too badly right?” Shadow muttered softly while patting Classic's head. Classic made a soft noise, rubbing his eyes before stretching all his limbs then grinned widely at Shadow showing him that he is fully awake now. Apparently, that made Shadow smile.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic quickly left before either of them saw him still lingering in the corridor.
                </p>

            </div>

            <p class="line-break">· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·</p class="line-break">

            <div class="paragraph-break">

                <p>
                    It's finally time for Classic to leave. Of course everyone would come and bid the little blue hedgehog goodbye. Classic happily took his time giving his goodbyes to each and everyone of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “We'll miss you Classic! Visit us whenever you can,” Amy said after giving Classic a squeezing hug.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “It's been great having you around, buddy,” Knuckles grins and fist bumps Classic who eagerly return the bump.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More handshakes and hugs were exchanged and finally Classic reached Shadow. Classic shyly smiled up at Shadow. Shadow offered a small smile as he knelt down to Classic's eye level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'll see you around now, Classic, thank you for spending time with me," Shadow said and held out his hand for a handshake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic immediately hugged Shadow tightly with a small squeeze that lasted longer than Sonic had liked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the two pulled apart, Classic leaned in and gave Shadow a kiss on the cheek causing Sonic's jaw to drop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>That's it!</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic grabbed onto Shadow's forearm and pulled him up. Shadow was stunned by Sonic's sudden action, letting himself get pulled but once he recovered, he glared at the blue hedgehog.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Sonic?! Hey! What are you doi&ndash;?!”
                </p>

                <p>
                    He was immediately cut off when Sonic grabbed onto his chin, turning his face to the side and then a pair of warm lips had made contact to his cheek.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “HUH?!” Shadow's cheek started to heat up, feeling completely confused by Sonic. He wanted to step away but apparently Sonic had an arm circle around his waist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic pulled away from the cheek kiss and hugged Shadow tightly from side as he narrowed his eyes at Classic, pouting. “This is <strong>MY</strong> Shadow!”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classic blinked a few times, looking surprised but it didn't last long as he just pouted and stuck his tongue out at Sonic before hopping through the portal that led him back to his home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the portal closed, everyone dispersed leaving Shadow and Sonic to settle whatever it is between them. Sonic's ears picked up on some snickers and sighs from his friends and even one of them going, 'Finally!'
                </p>

                <p>
                    Had he been so obvious to his friends?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tension became very tense once he and Shadow were left alone in the room. Sonic's arms held Shadow, suddenly feeling very conscious about the closeness between them, Sonic froze there unsure whether to move or not, especially since Shadow hadn't moved either.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Erm. . ." Sonic started, words fumbling as he didn't know how to break the silence or bring up the topic but luckily for him, he didn't have to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow had furiously pulled himself out of Sonic's grip and turned fully to glare at the blue hedgehog.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What. . . Was. . . THAT?!" Shadow snarled.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic is used to being the target of Shadow's rage and thus easily able to differentiate if he's truly angry or just playfully angry but this. This flustered and angry expression was new.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I. . . umm. . . what do you think that was?” Sonic asked, hiding his nervous trembling hands behind his back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow looked taken back as his eyes narrowed at Sonic, searching for an answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Is this one of your stupid jokes?” Shadow growled defensively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “No! Of course not!” Sonic quickly denied with both hands up in surrender.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Then. . . what do you mean by me being. . .” Shadow paused, his cheek darken. “Your Shadow. . .?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The sudden question made Sonic feel even more nervous, his own cheeks burning red, his body feeling restless and fidgety. Sonic licked his dry lips as he gazed downwards feeling a lump in his throat, too nervous to speak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What should he say? What could he say? Should he just be honest? What would Shadow think?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Can they still stay the same if he confesses?
                </p>

                <p>
                    A sudden weight on his shoulder snapped him out from spiralling deeper in thoughts then came the deep voice that he loved listening to so much.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Breathe, Hedgehog. . .”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic blinked and looked up at Shadow who was gazing at him in concern. Sonic felt grounded now as he stared at Shadow's calming red eyes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I'll. . . overlook this one time seeing how nervous you reacted,” Shadow said once he was sure Sonic is paying attention now. “But don't ever joke like this again.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    As Shadow's hand slid off Sonic's shoulder, Sonic quickly grabbed Shadow's wrist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “It's not a joke! I was being serious!” Sonic felt his own heart beating faster than before and how hot his cheeks were burning. "I'm. . . being serious."
                </p>

                <p>
                    He was scared but he didn't want to let Shadow go.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I'm serious about you, Shadow, I'm serious about liking you!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow looked surprised, his mouth open but Sonic continued, not giving him a chance to speak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I like you a lot and. . . I. . . I. . . hate it when you give Classic so much attention! I want your attention too! It's unfair that he gets to occupy you just because he was younger! I want to be the one that relaxes with you in the garden, I want to be the one enjoying lunch with you, I want to be the one you race with and I want to be the one that naps besides you!!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Sonic&ndash;"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I know! I know! He's a kid but I can't help it, ok? I was jealous, it's stupid but I was so so jealous! It's extremely stupid, we're not a couple yet but I couldn't help it, I really like you and I just want to be the one that made you laugh and smile and have fun with you. . ."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Sonic, can I&ndash;"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You were so happy spending time with Classic! It's rare to see you so relaxed with someone and I don't want to take that from you just because of my dumb feelings! I like you too much to take your happiness away. . . I know you probably don't want to see me again after doing that but I just want&ndash;"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Sonic!!" Shadow cut Sonic off by holding both of his cheeks, almost squishing them. "You're rambling. . ."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Oh&ndash;"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Now you be quiet and listen to me."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic nodded immediately after hearing Shadow's stern tone. He watched how Shadow took a deep breath and Sonic almost stopped breathing when he heard the next sentence Shadow said.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I like you too, romantically."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic's eyes widened in surprise. He didn't know it was possible that Shadow would feel that way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I know, I'm surprised as well, you're reckless, an idiot, unorganised, not disciplined."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic pouted, making Shadow let out a soft chuckle as he shook his head fondly at Sonic's reaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Yet so charismatic, brave and compassionate. . . I've been attracted to you for a long time now, you could even say that I'm completely smitten with you," Shadow said as he gently caressed Sonic's cheeks instead of squishing them. "What I'm saying is, I like you too, you dummy."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You. . . you do?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Don't make me repeat myself."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You like me. . ." Sonic repeated and a bright grin appeared on his face as his emerald eyes shone in realisation, he started to bounce around Shadow in excitement. "You like me!! You like me!!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was Shadow's turn to get completely flustered with his muzzle deeply coloured.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Stop! Shut up!!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "How can I? Shadow THE Hedgehog likes me! You return my feelings! Do you have any idea how nervous I was?" Sonic grinned wide, stopping beside Shadow and poking fun at him playfully.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I can imagine. . ." Shadow muttered, arm crossed as he looked away since it was getting hard to look straight at Sonic. "You're not the only one that gets jealous and nervous. . ."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Don't look at me like that. . . jealousy is a normal emotion," Shadow huffed and tried to hide his flustered face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hey! Tell me! I spilled my guts to you, embarrassed myself and admitted my jealousy. It's only fair if you are honest with me too!" Sonic pouted and once again bounced around and poked at Shadow who was as immovable as ever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "No, shut up."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Tell me!! When did you realise that you're jealous? When did you realise your feelings for me? I want to know! Tell me! Tell me!" Sonic grabbed onto Shadow's arm and swung it to annoy Shadow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "No, I'm not giving you the chance to tease me."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Fineee," Sonic stretched his words, placing his arms around Shadow as well as shifting all his weight on the Ultimate Lifeform. "Only because we're boyfriends now. . . besides I'll learn about it sooner or later."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sonic didn't miss the way Shadow's cheek darkened or how his ears flickered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You. . . want us to be. . . exclusive?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Do you?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow gazed at Sonic who stared back in anticipation and nodded softly. If Sonic wasn't paying attention, he would have missed Shadow's answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ". . .I do."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Then it's official!" Sonic giggled, arms wrapped around Shadow's waist as he lifted him up slightly doing a spin to show how happy he was. Shadow couldn't help but roll his eyes fondly at Sonic's silliness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once Sonic set Shadow back to the ground, he leaned in close, bumping their noses together. The grin and red blush never left Sonic's face even after their little confession.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You're mine. . ."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shadow blinked, ruby red eyes softened at the way Sonic looked at him like he was his everything. Perhaps Sonic's smile was contagious, making Shadow smile back at him. He wrapped his arms around Sonic's neck, pulling them closer as he leaned his forehead against Sonic's.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being this close to Sonic, feeling his arms holding him and feeling his warmth against his skin felt nice, it felt right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He didn't mind staying like this a little longer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "And you're mine. . ."
                </p>
